PrometheusFuels.com features a grainy, almost “comic-book” style of art with bright yet muted colors and a Bold, Cap-locked, sans-serif font. The site is particularly interesting in that it uses a lot of animation. I like the way the animations, artwork and bold font remind me of old school action movies.. Or atleast posters for such movies. I’m not entirely sure I’ll be able to implement the animations to the same level as this site does but the art style and font choice are definitely what I’ll be going for.

Lost Mechanic is similar to PrometheusFuels in that it also implements a more muted / dark color scheme, uses a bold sans serif font, features the grainy animation filtering, and uses many animations on its site. The grainy-ness and dark color scheme are big parts of why I chose this site as inspiration. I also appreciate the minimalism that Lost Mechanic features. They do it in a way that doesn’t make the site look low content.
